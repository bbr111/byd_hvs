## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Access live data from your BYD HVS Battery system, including State of Charge (SOC), voltages, currents, and temperatures.
- **Cell-Level Details**: Monitor individual cell voltages and temperatures for detailed analysis.
- **Customizable Scan Interval**: Configure how frequently the integration polls data from the battery.
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages and robust handling of connection issues.
- **Module Aggregation (new)**
  Each module is represented as a **single entity** containing all cell values as attributes:
  - **State:** Total summed module voltage (mV)
  - **Attributes:**
    - `cell_voltages`: list of all cell voltages
    - `cell_temperatures`: list of all cell temperatures
    - `max_voltage`, `min_voltage`, `avg_voltage`
    - `max_temperature`, `min_temperature`, `avg_temperature`

## Prerequisites

- **Home Assistant**: Ensure that Home Assistant is installed and running.
- **BYD HVS Battery System**: This integration is designed specifically for BYD HVS Battery systems with network connectivity.

## Installation

### Installation via HACS

Install HACS: If you haven't already, install the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS).

Add Custom Repository:

In the Home Assistant UI, navigate to HACS.
Click on the Integrations tab.
Click the three dots in the top right corner and select Custom repositories.
Add the URL of this repository and select Integration as the category.
Install the Integration:

Search for BYD HVS Battery in HACS.
Click Install to add the integration.
Restart Home Assistant: Restart your Home Assistant instance.

## Configuration

### Setup via the User Interface

Add Integration:

In the Home Assistant UI, navigate to Settings > Devices & Services.
Click Add Integration.
Search for BYD HVS Battery and select it.
Enter Connection Details:

IP Address: Enter the IP address of your BYD HVS Battery system.
Port: Default is 8080. Change if your system uses a different port.
Scan Interval: Set the polling interval in seconds (minimum 10 seconds).
Complete Setup:

Click Submit to complete the setup.
If the connection is successful, the integration will be added, and the sensors will be available.

### Options

The integration offers several configuration options that can be adjusted at any time from the **Home Assistant UI**
(Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí BYD HVS Battery ‚Üí Configure).

| **Option**                        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                       | **Default** |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Scan Interval (seconds)**       | Defines how often the integration polls the BYD HVS Battery for new data. The minimum recommended value is **10 seconds** to avoid overloading the system.                            | `10`        |
| **Show Cell Voltages**            | Enables detailed sensor entities for each **individual cell voltage**. Disable this if you prefer a cleaner setup or use the new aggregated module view.                              | `True`      |
| **Show Cell Temperatures**        | Enables detailed sensor entities for each **individual cell temperature**.                                                                                                            | `True`      |
| **Show Modules**                  | Adds the **module number** as part of the cell sensor names (e.g., ‚ÄúTower 1 Module 2 Cell 05‚Äù). Helpful for identifying the module-to-cell mapping.                                   | `False`     |
| **Reset Cell Counter per Module** | Resets the internal cell numbering after each module. For example, Cell 01‚ÄìCell 08 will repeat for each module.                                                                       | `False`     |
| **Show Towers**                   | Displays **tower-level diagnostic sensors**, such as balancing status, max/min cell voltages, and temperature statistics. Disable this if you only need overall battery data.         | `True`      |
| **Aggregate Modules**             | Creates **one summarized entity per module** that includes all cell voltages and temperatures as attributes. Each aggregated entity shows the total module voltage as its main value. | `False`     |

#### üí° Usage Tips

- For **detailed analysis**, keep **Show Cell Voltages** and **Show Cell Temperatures** enabled.
- For a **cleaner setup** with fewer entities, enable **Aggregate Modules** and disable the individual cell options.
- If you only want general system data (SOC, Power, etc.), disable **Show Towers** and **Aggregate Modules** entirely.
